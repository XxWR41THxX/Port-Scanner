Print_Lock was a valubale lesson here,
The more you learn in programming you realize, how much the machine underneath your fingertips is just a big dumb calculator that only knows the difference between 1s and 0s. 
This experience also brings you to realization...
its just 1s and 0s!!! 
I won't make any Matrix quotes here although the setup is tantalizing. 
And yes I am oversimplifying an abstract ever reaching idea that I'll let the more philosophical programmers tackle. 

                           Print_Lock

Interleaved - The method or process where two or more sequences, elements, or data streams are combined by alternating between them.

In a Python Multithread enivronment we must ensure that only ONE thread at a time can execute a block of code. Interleaving is a technqiue used to imporve data access or communication efficiency.

In Signal Processing interleaving is a technique used to rearrange data bits in a transmission to reduce the impact of burst errors. 

- Burst Errors - 
    A type of error pattern in a data transmission where a block of a data gets corrupted during transmission. 

Print_Lock essentially shares the print function resources efficiently throughout the multiple threads that you run, providing order and reliability in the output.

Python Modules:
Threading - Create and Control your Threads, Prevent race           conditions, Locks and Synchronizes different threads to run. 

Queue - Method to Queue up Data Structures in a First In, First Out Manner(FIFO)
    Queue Types:
    Queue - Standard FIFO Queue, Fist item Added is first item out
    LifoQueue - Last In, First Out Queue, similar to a stack
    PriorityQueue - Each Item has Priority that you can set. 


IPy - This module has been especially handy for me in subnet calculations and IP address Management in large to medium networks, making network automation really easy. 

tqdm - Progress Bar Module

colorama - The init() method makes this module quite easy to use to get some life in your program. 


Thank you Python
